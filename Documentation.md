# DDoS Attack Tool

## Overview

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is a type of cyberattack where an attacker attempts to disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. The DDoSBlitz tool, written in C, is an open-source utility designed to simulate a DDoS attack. This document provides detailed instructions for setting up and using DDoSBlitz on Termux.

## What is DDoSBlitz?

DDoSBlitz is an open-source DDoS attack tool implemented in the C programming language. It is used for educational purposes to demonstrate how DDoS attacks work. This tool is specifically designed to be used on Linux-based systems, including Termux on Android devices.

## Using DDoSBlitz with Termux

While Termux runs on a mobile device, it does not have the same power as a full server. As a result, DDoSBlitz may not be effective against large websites (e.g., Google, Facebook) but can still cause noticeable disruptions on smaller servers when used by multiple users simultaneously.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Termux**

   Download and install Termux from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/).

2. **Update and Upgrade Termux Packages**

   Open Termux and execute the following commands to update and upgrade your package list:

   ```bash
   apt update
   apt upgrade
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**

   Install `git` and `clang` which are needed to clone and compile the DDoSBlitz tool:

   ```bash
   pkg install git
   pkg install clang
   ```

4. **Clone the DDoSBlitz Repository**

   Download the DDoSBlitz source code from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/New71k/DDos/blob/main/DDoSBlitz.c
   ```

5. **Compile the DDoSBlitz Tool**

   Navigate to the DDoSBlitz directory and compile the source code:

   ```bash
   cd ddos
   clang DDoSBlitz.c -o DDoSBlitz
   ```

6. **Run the DDoSBlitz Tool**

   Execute the compiled tool, specifying the target website and port number. Replace `www.example.com` with the target domain and `80` with the target port:

   ```bash
   ./DDoSBlitz www.example.com 80
   ```
